## API Key Requirement üîë

To access InsightAI APIs, you must have a valid API key. 

### How to Get an API Key:
1. Visit our web app: [https://app.insightai.in](https://app.insightai.in).
2. Generate your API key under the "API Keys" section.
3. For assistance, contact our team at [akash@insightai.in](mailto:akash@insightai.in).

### Credit Limit and Exhaustion:
Your API key usage is subject to credit limits based on your subscription plan. If your credits are exhausted, the following error will be returned:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": 402,
  "message": "Credit limit exceeded. Please upgrade your plan or contact support."
}
```

### Sandbox Testing üõ†Ô∏è
The sandbox environment allows you to test our APIs without affecting production data. It is the perfect space to validate integration and explore InsightAI‚Äôs capabilities.

**How to Access the Sandbox:**
* Login to the web app: [https://app.insightai.in](https://app.insightai.in)
* Navigate to the "Sandbox Testing" section.
* Use the API key provided for sandbox testing.
Note: API responses in the sandbox are simulated to help you understand how the production system works.

### Authentication üõ°Ô∏è
Every API request requires the API key to be sent in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.

**Header Example:**
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Base URL
All API endpoints are available at the following base URL:
```

**Missing API Key Error:**
If the API key is not provided in the request, you will receive the following error:
